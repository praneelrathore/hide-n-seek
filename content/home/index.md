Hi, I am Praneel Rathore.

I am a software engineer with 3 years experience in the industry. I like to explore new technologies and like solving tough problems.

My other interests include football and gaming. I am a really big Manchester United fan (following them since 2003, so yeah not the plastic one :P). I love Dota 2 and like to play whenever I get time.

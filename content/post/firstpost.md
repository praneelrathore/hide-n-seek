## New Beginnings

Whenever I read blog posts over the internet, I always wondered how awesome it would be to have my own. As a software developer, we spend a lot of time learning new things everyday. There are new technologies we might be trying out to fit in our work tech stack, and it all starts from first developing things locally, trying few things on small starter projects, and then taking it to production. So I read about hugo recently, and thought that due to covid-19, I do have a lot of time in my hands, so let's try this and see where it goes. So here it is, to trying new things and documenting everything on my own blog. More to come..

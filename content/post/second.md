## Something to add today

I have not been getting time to work on my hugo blog lately, as things have been a bit hectic at work. Lol, who am I kidding, I am not able to work on it because I have been a lazy ass just sitting and procrastinating about stuff. I got a bit of free time today, so I thought to start work on my blog again. I added "About Me" page today, and also added my profile picture and links to my github, linkedin and twitter accounts. Will continue working and improving this site.
